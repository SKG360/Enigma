#Project:
Enigma

#Group Member Names:
Samuel Giles
Geoff Adebonojo

#Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
1. We complete through iteration 3
2. Solid design metrics
3. Test Driven Development
4. Improved Version Control

#Goals and expectations:
1. Strengthen enumerable handling
2. A strong test suite

#Team strengths:
1. Stragetizing, and Ideation to break project into manageable tasks, using minimal, testable assumptions. 

#How to overcome obstacles:
1. Strong channels of communication.
2. Back-up plan

#Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
Samuel is an early riser, Geoff is a night owl.

#Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
Slack is used for remote work. Interpersonal communication is constructive and given after sufficient reflection. 

#Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
We are in complete agreement about areas for desired improvement:
1. TDD principles
2. Enumberables
3. SOLID design
4. Driver-navigator pairs to practice the skillsets of muscle memory and explanation.

#Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
We started with pair development to set up the initial architecture and tests.
Then we separated to work on independent features: Geoff worked on the command line arguments, and reading/writing to files.
Samuel built the Enigma class and encryption algorithm.
We reconveined the integrate the two and to sketch out the methods for the decryption algorithm. 
Then we returned to individual work: Samuel refactored the Enigma algorithm to incorporate the extension characters; Geoff wrote the decryption algorithm.
We reconveniened a final time to finish integrating the encrypt/decrypt runner files with the CLI, to refactor and to plan approach for iteration 4.


#Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
1. We strove to use Git/GitHub best practices.
2. This involved a regular stream of commits of small, functional peices of code to separate branches, with descriptive commit messages. 
3. Pushes issued at regular intervals to appropriate branches.
4. Merging working branches into master when appropriate.

#Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
1. Keep it constructive.

#Agenda to discuss project launch:
overall stragegy to divide problems into managaeble tasks. Write tests from specs and methods from tests.
